# Obsidian Daily Devlog Automation

A Windows PowerShell automation that builds a dated **developer log** note in an
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault every morning, pre-populated with that day's
Outlook calendar meetings and the current/next Jira sprint stories assigned to me.
Both Claude Code and Obsidian work in Markdown, which makes this a lightweight daily
log compared to OneNote.

---

## What it does

A single scheduled task runs `create-devlog.ps1` daily at **7:00 AM** and again **at
logon**. Each run:

1. **Ensures the apps are up** — checks for Outlook and Obsidian; launches whichever
   is not running and waits for them to initialize.
2. **Locates/creates today's note** at `…\<vault>\devlog\<yyyyMM>\devlog <yyyyMMdd>.md`
   (a per-month folder, e.g. `devlog\202606\devlog 20260610.md`).
3. **Writes a friendly title** — `# Wednesday, June 10, 2026` (rebuilt deterministically
   each run, so it self-heals duplicate/malformed headers).
4. **`## Meetings` table** — `| Time | Meeting | Owner | Summary |` from the Outlook
   calendar (via COM). The Summary shows the meeting location (Zoom/Teams URLs become
   short clickable links like `[Zoom](…)`) and appends `Agenda: …` when the invite body
   contains a genuine agenda (join-link boilerplate is stripped).
5. **`## Tickets` table** — `| Ticket | Summary | Status | Points |` from Jira, grouped
   under bold **sprint subsection rows** for the active sprint and the next (future)
   sprint, e.g. `**UMT Sprint 5 (active)**` / `**UMT Sprint 6 (next)**`.
6. **Opens/focuses today's note** in Obsidian.

Both managed sections are created if missing and refreshed in place if present; any
other sections you add to the note by hand are preserved. Running multiple times a day
is safe and idempotent.

## Files

| File | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `create-devlog.ps1` | **The script.** Combined meetings + Jira generator (everything in "What it does"). Self-contained: app-launch/wait, section-aware Markdown parser (`Parse-Note`/`Rebuild-Note`/`Find-Section`), `Ensure-Header`, `Get-TodayMeetings` (Outlook COM), `Get-JiraTickets` (Jira REST), table builders, `Clean-Summary`/`Shorten-Location` for meeting summaries. Edit the config block at the top (`$vaultPath`, `$vaultName`, `$jiraEmail`) for another machine/user. |
| `setup-scheduled-task.ps1` | Registers the **`Obsidian Daily Devlog`** scheduled task (daily 7:00 AM + at logon) pointing at `create-devlog.ps1` in this folder (`$PSScriptRoot`). Uses `-Force`, so re-running updates the task in place. This is the only task you need. |
| `setup-jira-task.ps1` | **Legacy/superseded.** Used to register a separate `Obsidian Daily Jira Tickets` task (7:05 AM) for the standalone Jira script. That task has been unregistered now that `create-devlog.ps1` does both jobs. Kept for reference; do not run it. |
| `create-devlog-jira.ps1` | **Legacy/superseded.** The original standalone Jira-tickets script before it was merged into `create-devlog.ps1`. No longer scheduled; safe to delete. |
| `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Original step-by-step setup guide. **Predates** the Jira integration, monthly folders, friendly title, and tables — describes only the meetings-only version. Useful for the general approach (finding your vault, registering the task) but not literally current. |
| `PHASE2_GRAPH_API.md` | Roadmap doc: planned migration of `Get-TodayMeetings` from Outlook COM to the Microsoft Graph API (removes the Outlook-desktop dependency). Blocked as of 2026-04-29 by tenant Graph permissions; includes the implementation sketch and unblock options. |
| `README.md` | This file. |
| `.claude/` | Claude Code project settings for this repo. |

## Configuration

Set in the config block at the top of `create-devlog.ps1`:

- `$vaultPath` — absolute path to the Obsidian vault (currently the Candid OneDrive `Dev Docs` vault).
- `$vaultName` — vault display name used in `obsidian://open` URIs (`Dev Docs`).
- `$jiraEmail` — Atlassian account email for Basic auth (`kevin.crump@candid.org`).
- Notes are written to `…\<vault>\devlog\<yyyyMM>\devlog <yyyyMMdd>.md`.

### Jira integration

- **Auth:** HTTP Basic with `$jiraEmail` + a **personal Atlassian API token** read from the
  **User** environment variable `JIRA_API_TOKEN`. Create one at
  <https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens> — it must be a real API
  token (starts with `ATATT…`), **not** a Marketplace-app JWT (`eyJ…`), which 401s.
  The script reads the token via `[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(...,"User")` to
  avoid a stale inherited process value. If the token is missing, the Tickets section is
  skipped silently (meetings still run).
- **Endpoint:** `/rest/api/3/search/jql` (the plain `/search` endpoint returns 410 on this tenant).
- **JQL:** `project=UMT AND assignee=currentUser() AND (sprint in openSprints() OR sprint in futureSprints()) AND issuetype not in subTaskIssueTypes() ORDER BY rank ASC`.
- **Field ids (Candid tenant, project UMT):** story points = `customfield_12108`
  ("Story point estimate"); sprint = `customfield_10006`. (The Jira defaults
  `customfield_10016`/`10020` do **not** apply here.)

## First-time setup

1. Ensure Obsidian and Outlook desktop are installed; the target vault exists.
2. Create a Jira API token and set it as a **User** env var `JIRA_API_TOKEN` (log off/on
   so scheduled tasks inherit it).
3. From this folder, run `setup-scheduled-task.ps1` once (registers the daily task).
4. Optional: run `create-devlog.ps1` directly to generate today's note immediately.

## Maintenance

- **Change the schedule:** edit the time in `setup-scheduled-task.ps1` and re-run it,
  or edit the trigger in Task Scheduler.
- **Uninstall:** `Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Obsidian Daily Devlog" -Confirm:$false`
- **Rule for `.ps1` edits:** keep the script **plain ASCII** — non-ASCII characters (em
  dashes, curly quotes, box-drawing chars) cause PowerShell 5.1 encoding errors. Build
  any needed Unicode (e.g. box-drawing separators) from `[char]0xNNNN` at runtime.

## Roadmap

See `PHASE2_GRAPH_API.md` — migrate calendar reads from Outlook COM to Microsoft Graph
to drop the Outlook desktop dependency (pending tenant Graph permissions).
